# Arc v1.0
Arc is a Discord Bot written in Python, mainly made as a utilitarian bot with features such as kick, ban and userinfo.
## Requirements
To use Arc, you will need:
* Python 3.5 or above
* pip
* Discord.py
## Setup
Setup of Arc is fairly simple.
All you need to do is download the bot.py file, edit the token tag to contain your token, set a prefix and open with "python3 bot.py" and you're off!
You will get a message once the bot is up telling you that the bot is online and connected to the Discord API.
## How to get a token
So if you need to read this, you must be new to bot hosting, that's no issue, here is how to generate a token.
1. Go to [Discord Developer Home](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me),
2. Click the empty button to create a new application.
3. Give it a name and icon, a description you can skip.
4. Once the application is made, Scroll down and click "Create a Bot User" and agree to the warning.
5. Scroll down and click "Reveal Token", **it is important you never share this with anyone**.
6. Copy the token and paste it into where it says "Token Goes Here" in the bot.py file.
Now you're ready to run the bot!
